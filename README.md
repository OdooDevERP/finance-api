# Integrating FastAPI Framework with PostgreSQL Using Prisma ORM

You're diving into a powerful stack ‚Äî `FastAPI` + `PostgreSQL` + `Prisma ORM` is a sleek combo for building scalable, type-safe APIs with `Python`. Here's a step-by-step guide to get you rolling, with some excellent video walkthroughs to reinforce each stage:

## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Integration Guide

### 1. **Set Up Your Environment**
- Create a virtual environment and install FastAPI, Uvicorn, and Prisma client.
- [Prisma ORM with Python and FastAPI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21371tIb2yg) walks you through setting up FastAPI, installing Prisma clients, and starting a PostgreSQL server.

```bash
virtualenv env

env\Scripts\activate
source env/bin/activate

python -m pip install --upgrade pip

pip install setuptools
pip install wheel

pip install "fastapi[standard]"



```

### 2. **Configure Prisma with PostgreSQL**
- Define your database schema in `schema.prisma`.
- Set your `DATABASE_URL` to point to your PostgreSQL instance.
- [Add Prisma to Existing Database](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjHuHCRwtWo) shows how to baseline an existing database and run migrations across environments.

### 3. **Run Migrations and Generate Prisma Client**
- Use `prisma migrate dev` to apply schema changes.
- Generate the Prisma client with `prisma generate`.
- [Master Python Rest API Development With Fast API, Prisma ...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBUv7sjukqc) dives deep into config files, dynamic URLs, and API routes ‚Äî great for understanding how to structure your app.

### 4. **Build Your FastAPI Endpoints**
- Create routers, schemas, and services to handle CRUD operations.
- [FastAPI Prisma REST API CRUD with PostgreSQL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwS_JnpXdSg) is perfect for learning how to build a full CRUD API using Prisma and PostgreSQL.

### 5. **Connect FastAPI to PostgreSQL**
- Use Prisma‚Äôs Python client to query your database inside FastAPI routes.
- [How to build a FastAPI app with PostgreSQL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=398DuQbQJq0) explains PostgreSQL setup and connection, though it uses SQLAlchemy ‚Äî still helpful for understanding DB flow.

### 6. **Advanced Features & Async Support**
- If you're considering async ORM alternatives or want to compare Prisma with SQLModel, [Building a REST API with FastAPI, Async SQLModel, and ...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8WiIXMDydw) offers a great perspective on async architecture and dependency injection.
